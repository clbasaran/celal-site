# Celal Başaran - Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. I'm a student at Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University, and this site reflects my real projects, real progress, and real journey. Built with Apple Design Language V6, fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA), and designed to be honest and high-quality.

## Features
- Clean Apple-style UI (SF Pro, spacing system, neumorphism)
- Dynamic theme (light/dark)
- Admin dashboard to manage all data (projects, about me, blog, etc.)
- Static and real content only (no fake achievements)
- Deployed via GitHub Pages
